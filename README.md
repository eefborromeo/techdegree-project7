This is my submission for Project 7: Interactive Video Player.

In this project, I built an HTML5 video player using JavaScript and the HTML5 Video API. Using the supplied mockups, video files, and transcript, I built an interactive video player that synchronizes the video and the transcript. When a user clicks any part of the transcript it takes them to the appropriate place in the video.
